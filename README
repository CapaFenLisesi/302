This repository contains Latex code to compile a
set of lower-division undergraduate lecture notes
on Electricity, Magnetism, and Optics.

The code will only compile correctly if the following
standard Tex packages are installed:

epfs
charter
euler
fancyhdr
inputenc/utf8
babel/polutonikogreek/english

The document can be compiled by issuing the command

latex 302

in the lowest directory (containing the file 302.tex).

The document must be compiled at least three times to
get all of the cross-references and table of content
data correct.
